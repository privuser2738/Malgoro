# MalgoroPkg Repository Configuration
#
# This file defines Git repository sources for packages.
# IMPORTANT: Each repository can contain MULTIPLE packages!
#
# MalgoroPkg automatically discovers all packages in:
#   - packages/*/PKGINFO (multi-package repository)
#   - PKGINFO (single-package repository)
#
# Format:
# [repository_name]
# url = https://github.com/user/repo
# branch = main
